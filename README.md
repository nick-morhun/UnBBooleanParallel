# UnBBooleanParallel
An upgraded version of UnBBoolean by Danilo Balby. Created in 2012 for my Bachelor's thesis.

UnBBoolean is a 3D modeling tool to apply boolean set operations on primitive solids. It's based on Constructive Solid Geometry concepts. Java3D required. Includes a library to apply boolean set operations on solids, that can be used by any Java3D app.
Original project page is http://unbboolean.sourceforge.net/.
